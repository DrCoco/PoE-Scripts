# Path of Exile Scripts

These are scripts which I have used to enhance my Path of Exile experience.

I wrote these scripts to make certain Path of Exile tasks easier and to improve my Python abilities.

I'm uploading them to GitHub as I'm not playing Path of Exile as religiuosly as before.
Feel free to use these scripts as is (Not sure if any functionality is against ToS for any reason, use at your own risk). Not planning any ongoing maintenance for these scripts. Although if you find ways to improve these scripts I'd love to hear about it.

A lot of the functionality included here can be found in the PoE Profit Sheets written by u/PoEWealth. Which I started using myself after I discovered it.

There are some things which are unique which I have't seen in other PoE programs.
# Unique Features:
* Bulk Live Search - min quantity, max price
* Bulk Item Pricing - average price for given bulk orders

If you do use the scripts, the requirements.txt file should have all the required dependencies.
